# AstroPlant Maker LITE Edition

We have recently involved in the AstroPlant Citizen Science Project. After building our first “Maker Edition (ME)“ we considered to do some changes in order to save costs of materials to build the kit. New features in our "Maker LITE Edition (MLE)" are:

- New design, smaller size, low-cost
- A power supply unit hounsing made in plywood (avoiding 3D printed power-supply unit housing)
- A DIY hydroponic kit using IKEA 365+ containers
- A front window to check nitrient solution level
- Side handles
